## Hypothesis 1
The scope is an hospital using Isolettes, and concerns everything about the design, procurement, placement, operation and maintenance of such Isolettes.
### Losses
1. Loss of Life or injuries to the Infant
2. Hospital being sued by parents for malpractice
3. Damage of hospital reputation
4. Excessive distress to the workers
5. Excessive operation cost (eg too many nurses)
6. Excessive maintenance cost
### Hazards
1. Temperature too high (L1,L2,L3,L4)
2. Temperature too low (L1,L2,L3,L4)
3. Humidity too high (L1,L2,L3,L4)
4. Humidity too low (L1,L2,L3,L4)
5. Oxygen too high (L1,L2,L3,L4)
6. Oxygen too low (L1,L2,L3,L4)
7. Dangerously hot surface (L1,L2,L3)
8. (Maybe) Unauthorized actor tampers with the Isolette (this can actually be moved in the hospital operation procedures)

### Control structure

(Redundancy is good, but we still need to signal all component failures.)
