# 2 Set of safety requirements 

- Opposite of unsafe control actions 
- Causal Scenario

# Requirement

Safety/System goals -> High-level requirements -> Low-level requirements -> Software specification

Hith-level requirements: Redundancy for thermometer 

Low-level requirements: Voting algoritmo, taking into account a broken thermometer (multiple lowe level requirements)

Software specification: not needed at the moment.

we need to test low-level requirements and testing specification, we have to be able to test them. Reading the specifivation we should be able to write the test.

We must have to provide rationals in the paper.

## Format for writing the requirements

HTR-HR-01: Heater module, high-level requirement 1
