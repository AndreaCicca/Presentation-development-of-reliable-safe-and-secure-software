# Models Part 2

Reality is complex and we want simple answare. The model will be approximate, no perfect solution, too accurate is difficult to understand and use.

One on the most iportant model is **Chain of (Failure) events (Coe) Model**. Assumes linear causality is enought to understand the world.

If there is more than one cause, the model is not enough (Bhopal disaster). We like the ability to talk about root cause, we want to blame someone, but it's not always possible.
We need to look beyond the chain of events.

2 type of incidents:
- Component failure
- Component Interaction Accident
  - Arise in interactions among components
  - No components may have failed
  - Computers with software you have unlimited error of complexity

Unsafe and unreliable are 2 separated things, something can be unsafe but reliable, and viceversa.
Preventing component of functional failure is not enough.

# Saftware does not "Fail"

Software is pure desing and design do not "Fail". Can contrubute to unsafe system behavior (including human unsafe behavior).

Software allows almost unlimited system complexity. You can no longer plan, understand, anticipate and guard against all undesired interactions.

Context determines whether software is safe (Ariane 4 software was safe, when reused in Ariane 5 the spacecraft exploded).

The role of software in accidents almost always involves **flawed requirements**. Accidents today do not just result from component failures.
