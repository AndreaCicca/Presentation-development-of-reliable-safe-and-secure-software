# Introduction

A lot of time on requirements and attitude to critical development.
Safety crytical, live critical systems, mission critical systems, security critical systems.

Critical programming with a completly different mindset adn style.

With critical software you spend a lot of time in desing, conding and testing, the cost of testing in safety critical domain is very high (like 75% of the entire project cost).

The project for the course is a isolate (incubatrice in italiano).

# Safety general definition

Accident = Mishap = Loss: any undesired and unplanned event that result in a loss. => it dipends on the application and what we want to achieve.

System goals vs constraint (limits on how can achive the goals). Safety is absense of losses, it's a relative thing, before you have to define what is a loss.

Safety is a relative concept !!.


# Causality model
We need a model to explain how things work and help predict how they will behave in the future, a causality mode.

A model can be more or less usefull, sometime we use simple model even if reality is complex.
