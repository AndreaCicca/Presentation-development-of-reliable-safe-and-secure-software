## States 

The isolette is like a state machine. It has different states and transitions between them.

Self checking state (memory, display, etc) - > 
setting up state with 4 temperatures (minumu, maximun, minumum allarm, maximux allarm) by nurses -> 
wating for pressing "start button" -> 
normal mode operation -> ? 
degrade mode operation


Degraded mode operation:
When 1 thermometer is broken
When 1 heating surface is broken

We have 3 thermometer and 2 heating surfaces in total.
